<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

![Authentication](react-app/src/assets/Authentication.jpg)
### Authentication

The account holders user must create an account/profile so that they can log on to and out of the app. Administering users should be able to log on to the system. Both the client and the admin users will need to be authenticated with 2-Factor authentication.

![Account](react-app/src/assets/Overview.jpg)
### Accounts

The account holders user should be able to view and edit their bank account information, view their account balance and status, and view a summary of their transactions. Their account’s status level is based on the amount of tokens, which has allows for better interest rates and lower transaction fees.
